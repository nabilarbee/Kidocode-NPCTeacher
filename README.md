# Kidocode Roblox NPC Teacher

A Roblox NPC that uses AI and an FSM model that aims to teach Kidocode's students through Roblox as its medium.

## Description
Kidocode Roblox NPC Teacher is a Roblox-based educational NPC that leverages a Finite-State Machine (FSM) to interact with students and facilitate learning. The NPC integrates with Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash (Experimental) AI model to generate dynamic, curriculum-aligned questions based on Kidocode's learning syllabus.

The backend is built with NodeJS and hosted on Glitch, where it uses the Gemini API to generate content. Roblox fetches these questions asynchronously using Promise's service, ensuring smooth integration and real-time responsiveness within the game environment.
## Installation

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Roblox Studio](https://create.roblox.com) - Main Development Tool for Roblox.

## How It Works

### NPC Teaching Flow
The figure below shows the FSM Model I have designed for this NPC. Designed on [Evan Wallace's FSM Designer](https://madebyevan.com/fsm/)
![Teacher FSM Model](./TeacherFSM_Model.png?raw=true "Teacher FSM Model")

```
A - Idle/Searching
B - GoToPlayer
C - AskQuestion
D - WaitForAnswer
G - Check Answer
E - Attack Player
F - Return To NPC Spawn
a0 - Loops back to Idle/Searching
a1 - GoToPlayer
b0 - AskQuestion
b1 - failed to find player, back to Idle/Searching
c0 - Starts WaitForAnswer Timer
d0 - Answer is given go to CheckAnswer
d1 - Answer not given go to Attack Player
e0 - Go to Return to NPC Spawn
g0 - Go To Return to NPC Spawn
g1 - Answer wrong go attack player
f0 - go to idle/searching
```

    1. NPC checks if there are any players in its range.

    2. If there are any, NPC walks up to the nearest player in range.

    3. FSM transitions into an AskQuestion state.

    4. Roblox sends a request to the external NodeJS API server.

    5. Gemini AI generates a question and answer set.

    6. The NPC presents the question via a GUI and awaits a response.

    7. FSM handles player answer and transitions accordingly.

### Edge Case Handling
    - If API is unreachable, a fallback message is shown.

    - If the student answers incorrectly, the NPC transitions to an AttackPlayer state (for gamified feedback).

    - If the student is correct, the NPC responds positively and resets, going back to its spawn.

### API Setup
>[!WARNING]
> **DO NOT UPLOAD YOUR API KEY TO THE GITHUB REPO**
1. Get an API key from the LLM provider of your choice.
2. Safely keep your API key. (NEVER PUSH IT ONTO GITHUB.)
3. Add your API key to the server.js file.
4. After making modifications, restart the NodeJS server.
